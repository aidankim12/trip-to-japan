# Trip to Japan
## Description
This project is part of the odin project curriculum. The goal is to replicate the format of a webpage based on a provided image and information about the styling. It is created entirely using HTML and CSS. All images used are my own.

## Notes
Honestly, there are stil a variety of issues. My design does not work well when resizing the window (try shrinking it and the content overflows and the background does not stretch to fill the screen). 

None of the linked pages are complete either... For learning purposes I'll more than likely continue working on and revisit this when I have more time and knowledge. 

Also I realized looking at my comp110 22f repository that there isn't anything in it. That's because I didn't quite understand how pushing to github from VS Code worked at the time (I still don't, I just do it from the CLI).

# trip-to-japan

Substitute for landing page assignment in the odin project. Use flexbox to create a pretty page about my time in Japan in summer 2023. All images are my own.

Honestly, there are stil a variety of issues with the webpage. My design does not work well when resizing the window. Additionally I haven't completed any other pages (although not require by the assignment). I will likely revisit this at a later date to update content and revise HTML/CSS to fix this.

# Trip to Japan
## Description
The goal of this project was to use knowledge of HTML/CSS to replicate the format of a webpage. The assignment is part of the foundations path of the odin project. I opted to fill in the webpage with a little bit of information about my trip to Japan in 2023. All images are mine and all individuals drinking alcohol are over the legal drinking age in Japan.

## Notes
None of the linked pages are complete. In part because I'm lazy and also because I want to move on to the next section about JS. I'll definitely revisit the project however at a later date.

On an unrelated note, my comp110 22f repository doesn't have any commits (or as many as it should). That's largely because I didn't know how to commit and push changes in VS code while I was taking the class. I actually still don't and nowadays I just do it through the CLI.
